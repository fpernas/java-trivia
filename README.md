## Java Trivia Questions

Trivia exercises about Java. They are all based on the OCP Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 11 Developer Complete Study Guide book (link to the book in the O'Reilly platform: [link](/https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ocp-oracle-certified/9781119619130/) )

The exercises range a wide amount of topics, and they go from finding the output of a main method
to know if the class even compiles at all (hint: a lot of them do not).

The project is divided into v1 and v2 packages, just for my own organization. But inside each package,
the exercises are organized based on the topics they cover.
